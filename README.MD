# MIMMIS CV ADVENTURE

This is a CV I made for a javascript school assignment. It contains of various information about me in different kinds, and i tried to make different things happen on every page. It doesnt always work properly yet, but it's on its way!( Yes, mimmi sprite can appearantly fly). It has a moving mimmi, a slideshow with a few of my old projects, and contact information. The cat picture is supposed to be replaced by a self portrait soon. I had to revert to an old version because something stopped working, which is why everything is in the initioan commit. It is equal to the "Huge commit" version of  my other rep https://github.com/MimPMC/cv-start1dec-main .
